## Goblin Day 9

The group of goblins in the cave camouflage themselves with mud and leaves and head to the nearby forest. They gather the stinky woodland mud, mushrooms and some rotting wood using their tools. They follow the lessons learnt from previous experiments to construct a small mushroom farm.

The remaining goblins return to the cave late.

## Goblin Day 9

The group of goblins gather wood from the forest and stone from the mountain. The large stone table fits snugly in the cave entrance. The goblins successfully construct a hinged door with a mechanism which can be secured from the inside with a wooden bar. The goblins construct some pointy wooden pit traps around the cave entrance and disguise them with moss.

The goblins tracking the invaders return, guided by Sraagkagz to avoid the traps.

## Goblin Day 8

Gribble collects some more stinky woodland dirt and helps Shroomer build a more sustainable farm.

Skaggygroo and the cunning goblins stay behind collecting firewood and dry moss and light enough fire sticks for all the goblins.

The fire sticks are shared around, and Humblebrug provides their horned goblin spear to Rotsnag. The goblins all wait for nightfall, and travel to the village.

At the goblin cave, a group of four invaders appear in the night with swords, torches and some wooden arrow shooter. They catch the defenceless Humblebrug and Shroomer and chop off their heads, before anybody can react. Gribble uses a concealed sharp stone and stabs one invader, buying enough time to escape with the ever-cautious Sraagkagz. The invaders loot anything valuable, and destroy everything else, leaving only the dim light of the spawning pool behind.

The warring party returns to the cave with loot; 2 swords, one leather belt, one bed robe, 6 socks, 1 gold chain with jewels. A wooden crate containing 33 carrots (11 food units). And a second wooden crate containing 2 pickaxes, 2 hammers, one saw and 18 iron nails.

## Goblin Day 7

Graznag and Humblebrug return to the cave with 3 medium pink fish (3 food units total) and an old boot.
The large group of villagers return to the cave, proud of themselves, holding a large sword and a stick of fire.
Sraagkagz remains in the cave for the day tinkering with the knife and hammers, but fails to produce anything meaningful.

Borkle does not return to the cave.

## Goblin Day 6

The group of goblins led by Gnobbins returns to the cave with the two goblin corpses, dragging the defeated bear behind them. Rotsnag returns to the cave shortly after. Some goblins return the goblin corpses to the spawning pool and prays, the pool bubbles for a prolonged period of time.  Whilst, some goblins butcher the bear corpse, extracting 10 raw bear meat, 6 large bear bones, 20 small bear bones, 2 horned bear horns and 6 patches of bear fur.

Borkle returns to the cave.

The group lead by Gnobbins spends some time at the table attaching the two horns to Gnobbin’s bone spear, making a weapon resembling a large fork.

Gobby and Mabel return to the cave.
The goblins lead by Gnobbins, tend to the mushrooms, harvesting 4 mushrooms.


## Goblin Day 5

A group of goblins led by Snagrot spend the morning hastily making crude bone stabby things, before leaving in the afternoon to hunt.

A group of goblins led by Sraagkagz returns to the cave and carefully craft some pointy bone sticks using resources gathered outside.

Mabel and the group of goblins led by Sraagkagz help to move a large flat boulder into the cave.

Gribble spends the day investigating the cave.

Flarhgunnstow and Graznag return to the cave late into the night. 

## Goblin Day 4

Humblebrug spends the day in the cave making 11 beds of mud and moss.

The large group of goblins returns back to the cave with two goats in their net. Spraynard does not return. 
The goblins get together and perform their sacrificial ritual, killing the goats and spilling the guts into the spawning pit. The pit bubbles and glows. 
The goblins butcher the two goats, and salvage 2 goat furs, 12 goat bones, 2 goat skulls and 16 food units of raw goat meat.
After a busy day, the goblins have little time left to tend to the mushrooms. There is little required tending today and the goblins harvest nothing.

## Goblin Day 3

The larger group of goblins gather sticks and rocks from the woods and spend the day making some crude goblin hammers. They harvest 2 food units of mushrooms from the patch.

Borkle returns to the cave at night with a sack containing something.

Snagrot and Spraynard return to the cave at night with two spoons, a tin mug and a small rug.
Snagrot is missing their left arm.

Humblebrug, Mabel and Gooby spend most of the day collecting rocks and moss, they are the last to return. They return with 5 goblin-head sized rocks, and 6 goblin-arm sized pieces of moss.

## Goblin Day 2

The group of goblins tending to the mushrooms in the cave conclude the mushrooms aren’t ready to be harvested yet.

The team of goblins returns from the fishing trip with two empty sacks, a large green fish (2 goblin food units) and four smaller blue fish (1 goblin food unit each). 
Snagrot leaves and returns alone.


## Goblin Day 1

Some goblins return with mushrooms (8 goblin food units) and handfuls of dirt which is piled in a mound of 1m² in the cave. The goblins tear apart, squish and chew up the mushrooms in different ways and bury them in the mound. The goblins watch the patch closely overnight, but nothing happens.

Returning from the adventure to the settlement, goblins return with a sack of apples (12 goblin food units), two strings of sausages (4 goblin food units), two fishing harpoons, a large iron knife, a hammer, and a large but tangled fishing net.


## Goblin Day 0

Before there was just darkness and silence. Void of all taste and smell. 
Nothing to feel and no relative orientation against a centre of gravity.
Then there was lightness.
But somewhere in-between, there was dimness.
In the dimness, there was also few sensations, but a whisper.
The goblin god with their goblin tongue speaks your goblin name. 
**I am the God of Ordered Chaos. Survive, fulfil my desires and be rewarded. Follow your code.**

Emerging one by one from a mud-filled trough made from a dark thick stone, the tribe is spawned into a flat empty cave of uniform height. 
The room is lit only by the 1m² wide opening to the south in the day, and by the incandescent brown glow of the spawning mud at night.
Peering through the opening, you see a foggy landscape consisting of moorland with large patches of woodland in the east and distant south. 
In the distant south there’s a small village of wooden shacks by a lake.
A river running south from the mountains north can be seen not far to the east, with a collection of mud huts on the other side.
The cave entrance is at the foot of a large rocky mountain range which stretches far to the west and north, the highest peaks are tipped with snow.
