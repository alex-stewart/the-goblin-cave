## Goblin Day 3

The larger group of goblins gather sticks and rocks from the woods and spend the day making some crude goblin hammers. They harvest 2 food units of mushrooms from the patch.

Borkle returns to the cave at night with a sack containing something.

Snagrot and Spraynard return to the cave at night with two spoons, a tin mug and a small rug.
Snagrot is missing their left arm.

Humblebrug, Mabel and Gooby spend most of the day collecting rocks and moss, they are the last to return. They return with 5 goblin-head sized rocks, and 6 goblin-arm sized pieces of moss.

## Goblin Day 2

The group of goblins tending to the mushrooms in the cave conclude the mushrooms aren’t ready to be harvested yet.

The team of goblins returns from the fishing trip with two empty sacks, a large green fish (2 goblin food units) and four smaller blue fish (1 goblin food unit each). 
Snagrot leaves and returns alone.


## Goblin Day 1

Some goblins return with mushrooms (8 goblin food units) and handfuls of dirt which is piled in a mound of 1m² in the cave. The goblins tear apart, squish and chew up the mushrooms in different ways and bury them in the mound. The goblins watch the patch closely overnight, but nothing happens.

Returning from the adventure to the settlement, goblins return with a sack of apples (12 goblin food units), two strings of sausages (4 goblin food units), two fishing harpoons, a large iron knife, a hammer, and a large but tangled fishing net.


## Goblin Day 0

Before there was just darkness and silence. Void of all taste and smell. 
Nothing to feel and no relative orientation against a centre of gravity.
Then there was lightness.
But somewhere in-between, there was dimness.
In the dimness, there was also few sensations, but a whisper.
The goblin god with their goblin tongue speaks your goblin name. 
**I am the God of Ordered Chaos. Survive, fulfil my desires and be rewarded. Follow your code.**

Emerging one by one from a mud-filled trough made from a dark thick stone, the tribe is spawned into a flat empty cave of uniform height. 
The room is lit only by the 1m² wide opening to the south in the day, and by the incandescent brown glow of the spawning mud at night.
Peering through the opening, you see a foggy landscape consisting of moorland with large patches of woodland in the east and distant south. 
In the distant south there’s a small village of wooden shacks by a lake.
A river running south from the mountains north can be seen not far to the east, with a collection of mud huts on the other side.
The cave entrance is at the foot of a large rocky mountain range which stretches far to the west and north, the highest peaks are tipped with snow.
