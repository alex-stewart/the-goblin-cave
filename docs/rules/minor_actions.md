# Minor Actions

Certain minor actions can be taken for free, such as trading items, eating and reading a letter.
Minor actions can be taken at any time in the `#minor-actions` Discord channel.
The Game Master will respond to successful actions with the :white_check_mark: emoji and failures with the :x: emoji.

## Sproglins

Goblins can use a minor action to pray for a sproglin to be spawned.
A sproglin must be spawned with a specific purpose and will perform that task loyally and relentlessly until their death.
Sproglins are cowardly, weak and will not survive long outside of the cave, but are useful performing menial tasks such as cooking or farming.
A sproglin requires half the food as a goblin.
