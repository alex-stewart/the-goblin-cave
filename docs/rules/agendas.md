# Agendas

Once each goblin is spawned they are told by the Great Goblin God how to live their lives.
The game master will assign agendas randomly to each goblin.
Goblin attributes are private information.

## Karma
Each time an agenda condition is met, the relevant goblins will receive karma. 
Karma is hidden from all players until that goblin dies when it becomes public information.
