# Agendas

Once each goblin is spawned they are told by the Great Goblin God how to live their lives.
The game master will assign agendas randomly to each goblin.
Goblin agendas are private information.

## Karma
Each time an agenda condition is met by the tribe as a whole (not jus the individual), the relevant goblins will receive karma. 
Karma is hidden from all players until that goblin dies when it becomes public information.
The amount of karma for an action is not fixed and up to the Game master to decide.
More goblins meeting the conditions of the agenda, the greater the karma.
