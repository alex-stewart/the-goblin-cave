# Goblins

## Spawning
Goblins arenâ€™t born, they spawn from the spawning pit in the goblin cave.
Once the game has started, goblins can continue to spawn into the cave.
To request to be spawned into the game, make a request in the `#spawning-pit` Discord channel.

## Death
Certain actions, when failed, may have dire consequences.
A goblin which dies is removed from the game, the player may be given the choice to spawn as a new goblin.

## Hunger
Without food, goblins will die, one unit of food will feed a single goblin for a week.
Players must declare that they are eating as a minor action, as the Game Master cannot assume players are sharing nicely.

## Sleep
Goblins require sleep
