# Action Plans

## Game Cycle
Each week will have two designated action days specified by the Game Master.

On these days, a goblin may:

- Submit a new action plans in a the public `#action-plan-submission` Discord channel or private channel .

- Participate in an action play by replying to the action message.

## Flowchart
Complex actions with multiple steps should be submitted in the form of a flowchart. Action flow charts with more than *n* nodes are guaranteed to fail, where *n* is the number of participating goblins.

At the end of the day, the game master will evaluate each action plan and determine the outcomes depending on the number of goblins participating, with bonuses given for matching archetypes. Results of each action plan will be reported either publicly or privately at the Game Masters decision.
